# Notes

the backend is really starting to come together at this point. I got the entier db fully ported over to postgress. Its fully ported to a docker container that will automatically open up when it goes down so I'm pretty stoked about that. I downloaded pgAdmin for some kind of gui and lemme tell you it is not intuitive in the slightest. I'm googling things left and right just trying to find my damn tables. Its all good now i've got a rytham going but I'm really brushing up on my sql skills. If only it was bash or something id be pro.
