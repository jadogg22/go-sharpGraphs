# go-sharpGraphs

This is an internal revenue reporting tool created for sharp transportation. This tool is more of a passion project that i've created in my free time when I'm not helping out with my other duties. It came about by my boss needing a report done that mcloud could not do. It started out as a cl tool that would take in a excel file and output a nice graph with the needed data. Now its a full stack application frontend written with react and javascript - not really my forte. The backend is written in go with a postgres and mysql database. Inorder to get all the data I've integrete with our backend system mcloud. Also to reduce strain on the mcloud servers I've implemented a postgress database as a type of cache for the data that is also hosted along side the backend.

Odviously, I'm not going to allow access to the internal data of the company. But in the future I may create some kind of "random" data generator to show off the project if you would like to see what it looks like. The front end isn't my best work. Personally I've never been in love with javascript, or frontend design in general. But I do think that my Golang backend is quite nice. I've implemented a couple of caching methods. Fun sql queries, and a couple of other things that I think are interesting. I've never really worked on a full stack project quite like this but as messy as it is I'm quite happy with it.

## running the project

Unfortunately, I havn't really worked on this random data functionality quite yet. So you'll just have to use your imagination. although feel free to snoop around and see my proficency in go lol.
