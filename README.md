# go-sharpGraphs

This is a simple revenue reporting tool that takes in reports from mcloud and generates reports from those. backend is written in go and the frontend is react and then is made static and hosted with go.

## running the project

Odviously I'm not going to include our internal company data in this repo, If you are a sharp guy connect with me and I can get you the proper .env file to get this running properly. If you are not a sharp guy, you can still run this project, with the included sample data. this will just be a local sqlite database with some sample data. to prove its working.
## Dispatchers

The dispatchers are hardcoded to be over spacific areas, if they change the dispatchers will need to be updated. in the function getLocation in pgk/database/dispatcher.go.
